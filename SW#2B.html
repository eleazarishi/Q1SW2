    <td>A woman well-regarded in San Diego for her high social station. Having grown up together as childhood friends, Maria Clara and Ibarra are engaged to be married, though Father Damaso(her father)is displeased with this arrangement and does what he can to interfere.</td>

    <td>A wealthy young man of mixed Spanish and Filipino ancestry who has recently returned to the Philippines from Europe after spending seven years studying abroad. Ibarra is cultured and well-respected, though the friars in his hometown of San Diego are suspicious of him. </td>

    <td>A Filipino socialite and well-respected member of the country’s wealthy elite. Close with high-ranking clergy members like Father Salvi and Father Damaso, Captain Tiago is one of the richest property owners in Manila and San Diego. As for his own disgrace, Captain Tiago is not actually Maria Clara’s biological father—rather, his wife had an affair with Father Damaso before dying in childbirth. </td>

    <td>A Spanish friar living in the Philippines, Father Damaso is an arrogant and pedantic priest who, despite having lived amongst Filipinos and hearing their confessions for over twenty years, is barely able to speak or understand Tagalog, the country’s native language. A shameless loudmouth, he is unafraid of slandering nonreligious citizens who he thinks undermine his power.</td>

    <td>A serious and committed Spanish friar who takes over Father Damaso’s post in San Diego as the town’s priest. Fray Salvi is a meticulous and cunning man who uses his religious stature for political influence, benefitting both himself and the church. He is often at odds with the town’s military ensign, volleying back and forth for power over San Diego and its citizens.</td>
